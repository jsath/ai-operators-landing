      <h1>Best OpenClaw Consultant<br><span class="green">in 2026: How to Choose</span></h1>
      <p class="page-subtitle">OpenClaw is still new. The consultant market is small. That means there's a huge gap between people who actually know what they're doing and people who just watched a YouTube video.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="article-body">
    <div class="container-narrow">

      <p>Let me be upfront: I'm going to tell you how to choose the best <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consultant</a>, and then I'm going to make the case for why it's me. You can evaluate that claim yourself.</p>

      <p>But first, the objective criteria. Because even if you don't hire me, you should know what to look for.</p>

      <h2>The 5 criteria that matter</h2>

      <h3>1. Daily usage</h3>

      <p>The best OpenClaw consultant uses OpenClaw every single day. Not as a demo. Not for testing. As a core part of their business operations.</p>

      <p>Why? Because OpenClaw is a living system. Models update. APIs change. Edge cases surface over weeks of use, not days. Someone who's been running an agent daily for months has encountered problems — and solved them — that a weekend tinkerer never will.</p>

      <h3>2. Real business results</h3>

      <p>Ask for specifics. Not "I helped a client automate their workflow." That's meaningless. You want: "I built an agent that handles morning briefings, CRM updates, and lead scoring for a SaaS founder. It saves them 3 hours daily and replaced their $3K/month VA."</p>

      <p>Specifics show experience. Vagueness hides inexperience.</p>

      <h3>3. Business understanding</h3>

      <p>The best consultant isn't just technical. They understand business. They know what ROI means. They know which workflows are worth automating and which aren't. They can look at your operation and say "automate this, don't automate that."</p>

      <p>A pure techie will build you a beautiful system that solves the wrong problem. A good consultant solves the right problem efficiently.</p>

      <h3>4. Communication and delivery</h3>

      <p>You're paying for results, not potential. The best consultants are clear about deliverables, timelines, and expectations before any money changes hands. They send scope documents. They follow through. They're available when things break.</p>

      <h3>5. Skin in the game</h3>

      <p>Does this person run their own business? Do they use AI agents to run it? Or are they just consulting about a thing they read about?</p>

      <p>The best consultants eat their own cooking. Their agent runs their business. They've felt the pain of a broken config at 2am. That experience translates directly to building better systems for clients.</p>

      <h2>Why Johann</h2>

      <p>Now the pitch. Judge it against the criteria above.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily usage:</strong> My agent Jars runs 24/7 and handles roughly half my business operations. Morning briefings, CRM, code builds, research, website deployments, GitHub backups. <a href="/learn/openclaw-use-cases">See the full list</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Real results:</strong> I've generated over $10K in consulting revenue helping other founders set up OpenClaw. Clients see ROI within the first month.</li>
        <li><strong>Business understanding:</strong> I sold my first company at 20. I run a SaaS called DMpro. I think in terms of revenue, margins, and time-to-value — not just cool technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I do a 15-minute discovery call, send a clear scope document, and deliver within 1-2 weeks. No surprises.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin in the game:</strong> I literally built this website with my OpenClaw agent. I'm not theorizing. I'm doing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What about other consultants?</h2>

      <p>They exist. The OpenClaw community is growing. Some people doing good work. Here's how to find them:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check the <a href="https://www.skool.com/ai-operators-5011/about" target="_blank">AI Operators community</a> — active members who share their setups are usually the real deal</li>
        <li>Look at their GitHub activity — are they contributing to OpenClaw or building on it?</li>
        <li>Ask to see their agent in action — live demo, not a slide deck</li>
        <li>Check for a track record — have they actually helped anyone, or just talk about it?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The market is small enough right now that the best consultants are easy to find. They're the ones actively building and sharing in public.</p>

      <h2>Questions to ask before hiring anyone</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>"Can you show me your own OpenClaw agent running?"</li>
        <li>"What specific workflows have you automated for clients?"</li>
        <li>"What's your timeline and what are the deliverables?"</li>
        <li>"What happens if something breaks after setup?"</li>
        <li>"What's the ongoing cost after you're done?"</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If they can't answer these clearly, keep looking.</p>
