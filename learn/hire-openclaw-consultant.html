      <p class="page-subtitle">OpenClaw is powerful. But setting it up wrong wastes time and money. Here's how to find an OpenClaw expert who actually delivers.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="article-body">
    <div class="container-narrow">

      <p>OpenClaw is open-source. Anyone can download it. But "can download it" and "can set it up properly" are two very different things.</p>

      <p>A bad setup means an agent that hallucinates, forgets context, misses tasks, or burns through API credits doing nothing useful. A good setup means an AI employee that saves you hours every day.</p>

      <p>The difference is the person configuring it. So let's talk about how to hire an <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consultant</a> who knows what they're doing.</p>

      <h2>What to look for in an OpenClaw expert</h2>

      <h3>1. They actually use OpenClaw themselves</h3>

      <p>This is non-negotiable. If someone is selling OpenClaw consulting but doesn't run their own agent daily, walk away. You want someone who's lived with this tool. Who's hit the edge cases. Who knows what breaks at 3am on a Sunday.</p>

      <h3>2. They can show you their agent</h3>

      <p>Ask for a demo. Not a slide deck. Not a landing page. Show me the agent. Show me what it does. Show me the morning briefing it sent today. If they can't show you a working system, they don't have one.</p>

      <h3>3. They understand your business, not just the tech</h3>

      <p>The best OpenClaw setups aren't about the technology. They're about understanding which workflows to automate and how to structure the agent for your specific situation. A good consultant asks about your business first and talks about tech second.</p>

      <h3>4. They've done it for other people</h3>

      <p>Building your own agent is one thing. Building one for someone else — understanding their workflows, their tools, their communication style — that's a different skill. Look for someone with actual consulting experience.</p>

      <h2>Red flags to watch for</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>"I can automate everything"</strong> — No one can. Good consultants are honest about what works and what doesn't.</li>
        <li><strong>No discovery call</strong> — If they quote you a price without understanding your business, they're selling a template, not a solution.</li>
        <li><strong>Vague deliverables</strong> — "AI setup" means nothing. You want specific: which agents, which integrations, which workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>No ongoing support</strong> — The first week after setup is critical. Things will need tweaking. Make sure they're available.</li>
        <li><strong>They've never heard of SOUL.md or AGENTS.md</strong> — These are core OpenClaw concepts. If they don't know them, they're learning on your dime.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What a good engagement looks like</h2>

      <p>Here's the process I follow when I do <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consulting</a>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>15-minute discovery call</strong> — We talk about your business, your pain points, and what you want to automate. I assess whether OpenClaw is the right tool for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope document</strong> — I send you a clear breakdown of what I'll build, what integrations are needed, and the timeline.</li>
        <li><strong>Server setup</strong> — I provision and configure your VPS with OpenClaw, security, backups, the works.</li>
        <li><strong>Agent building</strong> — Custom agent configs, memory systems, personality, tool connections. This is the bulk of the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing</strong> — Running the agent through real scenarios. Tweaking prompts. Making sure output quality is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Handoff</strong> — Walking you through how everything works. Teaching you how to update configs and manage the agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Support window</strong> — Available for questions and fixes in the weeks after launch.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The whole thing takes 1-2 weeks. Not months. Not quarters.</p>

      <h2>Pricing expectations</h2>

      <p>OpenClaw consulting isn't cheap, but it's a fraction of what you'd spend on a developer or a VA over time. Expect to pay a one-time setup fee plus minimal ongoing server costs ($20-50/month).</p>

      <p>For detailed pricing: <a href="/learn/openclaw-setup-cost">How Much Does OpenClaw Setup Cost?</a></p>

      <p>The ROI math usually works out fast. If your agent saves you even 2 hours a day, you've paid for the entire setup within the first month. Most people see much more than that.</p>

      <h2>Why I do this</h2>

      <p>I'm <a href="https://johann.fyi" target="_blank">Johann</a>. I sold my first company at 20. Now I run DMpro and help other founders set up the same AI systems I use daily. My agent Jars handles CRM, outreach, morning briefings, code builds, research — about half my business operations.</p>

      <p>I started doing <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consulting</a> because people kept asking me how my agent worked. Turns out, most people don't want to spend weeks learning the system. They want it set up and running.</p>

      <p>So that's what I do.</p>
