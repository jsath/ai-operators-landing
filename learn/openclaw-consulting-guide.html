      <p class="page-subtitle">You've heard about AI agents. Maybe you've tried ChatGPT. But you want something that actually runs your business. That's where OpenClaw consulting comes in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-narrow">

      <p>Let me save you some time. <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consulting</a> is when someone who actually knows OpenClaw sets it up for you. Not a tutorial. Not a course. Someone builds your AI agent, configures it for your specific business, and hands you the keys.</p>

      <p>That's it. That's the service.</p>

      <p>But let me explain why that matters more than you think.</p>

      <h2>What is OpenClaw?</h2>

      <p>OpenClaw is an open-source framework that turns AI models like Claude into persistent, autonomous agents. Think of it as the operating system for an AI employee.</p>

      <p>Without OpenClaw, AI is just a chatbot. You type, it responds, you close the tab. With OpenClaw, your AI agent runs 24/7. It remembers context. It connects to your tools. It takes actions without you sitting there.</p>

      <p>The problem? Setting it up isn't trivial. You need a server. You need to configure memory systems, tool integrations, scheduling, and permissions. You need to write agent configs that actually produce useful output.</p>

      <p>Most people who try to DIY this spend weeks fiddling with configs and still end up with something half-broken.</p>

      <h2>What does an OpenClaw consultant actually do?</h2>

      <p>An <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consultant</a> handles all of that for you. Here's what a typical engagement looks like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discovery call:</strong> 15 minutes to understand your business, workflows, and what you want automated</li>
        <li><strong>Server setup:</strong> Spinning up and configuring your OpenClaw instance on a VPS</li>
        <li><strong>Agent configuration:</strong> Building custom agent configs for your specific use cases</li>
        <li><strong>Tool integrations:</strong> Connecting your CRM, email, calendar, Slack, whatever you use</li>
        <li><strong>Memory & personality:</strong> Setting up the agent's memory system and communication style</li>
        <li><strong>Testing & iteration:</strong> Running the agent, tweaking until it produces great output</li>
        <li><strong>Handoff & training:</strong> Showing you how to manage and update your agent</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The whole process takes 1-2 weeks. At the end, you have a working AI employee that handles real tasks in your business.</p>

      <h2>Who needs OpenClaw consulting?</h2>

      <p>Not everyone. If you're a developer who loves tinkering with configs and has time to spare, you can absolutely set this up yourself. The <a href="/learn/openclaw-tutorial">OpenClaw tutorial</a> will get you started.</p>

      <p>But if you're any of these people, you probably want help:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Founders</strong> who need results this week, not this quarter</li>
        <li><strong>Agency owners</strong> drowning in repetitive client work</li>
        <li><strong>Non-technical people</strong> who want AI agents but don't want to learn server administration</li>
        <li><strong>Business owners</strong> currently paying $3-5K/month for VAs doing work an AI could handle</li>
        <li><strong>Anyone who tried DIY</strong> and got stuck or frustrated</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The common thread: you value your time more than the cost of having someone do it right.</p>

      <h2>What you get vs. what you don't</h2>

      <div class="before-after">
        <div class="ba-card after">
          <h4>What You Get</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Fully configured OpenClaw instance</li>
            <li>Custom agent built for your workflows</li>
            <li>All tool integrations set up</li>
            <li>Agent running and producing value day one</li>
            <li>Training on how to manage it yourself</li>
            <li>Ongoing support for questions</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="ba-card before">
          <h4>What This Isn't</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>A course or info product</li>
            <li>Generic templates with no customization</li>
            <li>Ongoing monthly retainer (unless you want one)</li>
            <li>Vaporware or promises without delivery</li>
            <li>A chatbot dressed up as an "agent"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Why not just use ChatGPT?</h2>

      <p>I get this question a lot. Here's the short answer: ChatGPT is a conversation. OpenClaw is an employee.</p>

      <p>ChatGPT can't check your inbox at 7am and send you a briefing. It can't update your CRM when a deal moves forward. It can't run overnight builds or back up your GitHub repos.</p>

      <p>An OpenClaw agent does all of that. Automatically. Every day. While you sleep.</p>

      <p>Read the full breakdown: <a href="/learn/openclaw-vs-chatgpt">OpenClaw vs ChatGPT</a></p>

      <h2>How to get started</h2>

      <p>It starts with a 15-minute call. No pitch deck. No sales funnel. Just a conversation about what you need and whether OpenClaw is the right fit.</p>

      <p>If it makes sense, we map out the setup and get started. If it doesn't, I'll tell you that too. I've turned people away when the ROI didn't make sense for them.</p>

      <p>I'm <a href="https://johann.fyi" target="_blank">Johann</a>. I'm 21, sold my first company at 20, and I've been running my own OpenClaw agent (named Jars) for months. It handles half my business. I've helped other founders set up the same system through <a href="https://johann.fyi/openclaw-consulting" target="_blank">OpenClaw consulting</a>.</p>
